  "PostToolUse hook for Edit: detect doubled tokens in modified files.

  Catches rename artifacts that produce syntactically valid but obviously
  wrong identifiers — the #1 uncaught bug class that linters miss.

  Examples:
    replace_all old='latest' new='observations_latest'
    → pre-existing 'observations_latest' becomes 'observations_observations_latest'

    replace_all old='get' new='get_b2'
    → pre-existing 'get_b2_client' becomes 'get_b2_b2_client'

  Two detection strategies:
    1. Identifier split: extract identifiers, split by _ or -, check for
       repeated consecutive parts at any subsequence length
    2. Regex: concatenated doubles without separator (getget, foofoo)

  Only identifiers the edit INTRODUCES are reported — new-string is
  compared against old-string. Scanning the whole file instead means one
  pre-existing match blocks every later edit to that file forever; see
  check-edit for what that cost in practice.

  PostToolUse cannot undo the edit — a block-decision surfaces the finding
  as conversation context so Claude can fix the identifier immediately."

  files: every one was followed by a byte-identical retry that
  succeeded, so nothing was being prevented and each block cost a turn.
  The worst example was a date, `Cowgill-3-3-26`, blocking 42 edits to a
  document it had nothing to do with.
