# Architecture

## Three Execution Contexts

cch operates in three distinct contexts with different constraints:

### 1. Hook Execution (hot path)

**Budget: <50ms total including Babashka startup.**

When Claude Code invokes a tool, it spawns a bb subprocess for each matching hook. The subprocess reads JSON from stdin, runs the hook logic through a middleware chain, and writes JSON to stdout.

```
Claude Code                    bb subprocess
    │                              │
    ├─── JSON on stdin ──────────► │ proto/read-input
    │                              │ middleware chain (timing → error → logging → handler)
    │ ◄── JSON on stdout ──────── │ proto/write-response!
    │                              │ fire-and-forget sqlite3 spawn
    │                              ▼ exit 0
```

**Performance breakdown (~12ms total):**
- bb startup: ~8ms
- Namespace loading: ~2ms
- JSON parse + hook logic: ~0.5ms
- Fire-and-forget log: ~1.3ms (non-blocking)

### 2. CLI (`cch`)

Human-invoked commands for managing hooks. Reads/writes JSON settings files and queries SQLite. No latency constraints.

### 3. Dev Server (`cch dev`) — planned

Long-running process: httpkit web dashboard + nREPL + file watcher. For debugging and interactive hook development.

## Hook Authoring Model

### defhook Macro

`defhook` eliminates the boilerplate of reading stdin, parsing JSON, handling errors, logging events, and formatting output. You write only the decision logic.

```clojure
(defhook scope-lock
  "Enforces file edit scope per worktree."
  {:event "PreToolUse" :matcher "Edit|Write"}
  [input]
  (check-scope (proto/extract-file-path input) (:cwd input) (worktree-root)))
```

This expands to a `-main` function that:
   - Reads JSON from stdin via `proto/read-input`
   - Injects `:cch/hook-name` into the input map
   - Runs the body (as an anonymous fn) through the middleware chain
   - Writes the result to stdout via `proto/write-response!`

Hook wiring metadata (event type, matcher pattern) lives in `cli/registry.clj` — the single source of truth for `cch install`.

### Decision Protocol

Hook functions return `nil` (allow) or a decision map:

```clojure
nil                                    ;; allow — fastest path, no stdout
{:decision :allow :reason "..."}       ;; explicit allow
{:decision :ask   :reason "..."}       ;; prompt user
{:decision :deny  :reason "..."}       ;; block tool call
```

This maps to Claude Code's JSON response envelope:

```json
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
    "permissionDecision": "ask",
    "permissionDecisionReason": "scope-lock: edit outside worktree"
  }
}
```

## Middleware

Ring-style middleware: `(fn [handler] (fn [input] result))`.

The chain is pre-composed at load time via `reduce`/`comp`, so at runtime it's a single function call through nested closures. Measured overhead: ~0.05ms.

### Default Stack

```
wrap-timing
  └── wrap-error-handler
        └── wrap-logging
              └── check (your hook logic)
```

| Middleware | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `wrap-timing` | Measures elapsed ms, attaches to result metadata |
| `wrap-error-handler` | Catches exceptions, returns `{:decision :deny}` with error message |
| `wrap-logging` | Fire-and-forget SQLite event insert via sqlite3 CLI |

### Custom Middleware

Override the stack in `defhook`:

```clojure
(defhook my-hook
  "..."
  {:middleware [my-custom-middleware mw/wrap-error-handler]}
  [input]
  ...)
```

## Event Logging

### SQLite via CLI

Events are logged to `~/.local/share/cch/events.db` (XDG_DATA_HOME). The key design choice: we spawn the `sqlite3` CLI as a fire-and-forget process rather than using the SQLite pod.

**Why sqlite3 CLI over pod-babashka-go-sqlite3:**
- No pod installation required
- No additional startup latency
- sqlite3 is universally available
- ~1.3ms non-blocking spawn

**Tradeoff:** SQL construction via string formatting instead of parameterized queries. Values are escaped via single-quote doubling.

### Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
  id, timestamp, session_id, hook_name, event_type,
  tool_name, file_path, cwd, decision, reason, elapsed_ms, extra
);
```

Indexed on: session_id, timestamp, hook_name, decision.

## Settings.json Management

### How Hooks Get Wired

`cch install scope-lock` adds this to `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Edit|Write",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "bb -cp \"~/.local/share/cch/repo/src:$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/src\" -m hooks.scope-lock # cch:scope-lock"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

The trailing `# cch:scope-lock` comment is a tag that lets `cch uninstall` find and remove exactly this entry without disturbing other hooks.

### Classpath Strategy

The hook command includes two classpath entries:

1. **`~/.local/share/cch/repo/src`** — framework core + built-in hooks (global)
2. **`$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/src`** — project-local hooks (optional overrides)

A project can override any built-in hook by providing the same namespace locally.

### Global vs Project

- **`cch install <hook>`** — writes to `.claude/settings.local.json` (project-local, default)
- **`cch install <hook> --global`** — writes to `~/.claude/settings.json` (all projects)

Claude Code merges both at session start.

### Atomic Writes

Settings files are written atomically: write to `.tmp`, then rename. This prevents Claude Code from reading a partially-written file.

## Configuration

### Three-Tier Merge

```
~/.config/cch/config.edn          Global defaults
  ↓ merge
<project>/.claude-hooks.edn       Project settings (committed)
  ↓ merge
<project>/.scope-lock.edn         Hook-specific (walks up from cwd)
```

Later tiers win for scalar values. Maps are deep-merged.

### Config Discovery

Hook-specific config files (like `.scope-lock.edn`) are found by walking up the directory tree from the current working directory, bounded by the project/worktree root. This enables per-subdirectory narrowing — e.g., `infrastructure/homelab/.scope-lock.edn` only applies when Claude's cwd is within that subtree. The boundary prevents stray config files above the project root from silently applying.

## Hook Types

Claude Code supports four hook types. cch currently implements `command` but the architecture can accommodate all four.

| Type | How it works | cch approach |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `command` | Shell command, JSON stdin/stdout | **Implemented.** defhook macro + middleware chain |
| `http` | POST event JSON to a URL | Dashboard server (Phase 4) can serve as the endpoint |
| `prompt` | Claude evaluates a prompt template | CLI generates settings.json entry (no Babashka needed) |
| `agent` | Subagent with Read/Grep/Glob access | CLI generates settings.json entry (no Babashka needed) |

For `prompt` and `agent` types, the framework's role is purely configuration management — generating the correct settings.json entries via `cch install`. The execution is handled by Claude Code itself.

For `http` type, the planned dashboard server (`cch dev`) could serve as both a debugging UI and a hook endpoint, receiving events via POST and applying decision logic.

### Extensibility: Pure Functions Across Hook Types

The pure-function-plus-defhook-wrapper pattern is designed for this. A function like `check-scope` takes plain data arguments and returns a decision map — it knows nothing about stdin, HTTP, or subagents. `defhook` generates the `command` type wiring (stdin → parse → call → respond), but the same `check-scope` function can be called from an HTTP handler:

```clojure
;; In the dashboard server (Phase 4)
(defn handle-hook-request [req]
  (let [input (parse-body req)]
    (respond (scope-lock/check-scope
               (get-in input [:tool_input :file_path])
               (:cwd input)
               (scope-lock/worktree-root)))))
```

This is why hooks should keep decision logic in standalone functions rather than inline in `defhook` — the function is reusable across all hook types.

## Design Principles

1. **nil is allow.** The fastest path produces no output. Only non-nil decisions generate JSON.

2. **Pure logic, then wire.** Keep decision logic in pure functions. `defhook` handles the I/O boundary.

3. **Fire and forget.** Logging must never delay the hook response. The sqlite3 process is spawned without waiting.

4. **Explicit over magic.** Hook entries in settings.json are tagged with `# cch:name` for traceability. Config files are plain EDN at known paths.

5. **Test like Claude Code would.** Integration tests spawn `bb -m hooks.name` as a subprocess with JSON on stdin — the exact invocation path Claude Code uses.
